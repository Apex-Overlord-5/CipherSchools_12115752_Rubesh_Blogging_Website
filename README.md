**WINTER PEP PROJECT** 

**Name of Project: RUBESH 12115752 LPU MERN Blog APP SUBJECT: MERN STACK** 

**From: 10/01/2024 to 13/02/2024** 

**INTRODUCTION** 

This project introduces a MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack application for creating a robust Rubesh Blogging Website. Users can seamlessly publish and manage blog posts, securely stored in a cloud-based MongoDB database. The backend relies on Node.js and Express.js, while React.js crafts an intuitive frontend. The primary function enables users to effortlessly compose and publish blog content. Once published, the system generates a unique link for easy access to the latest blog post. Users can conveniently share and access their blogs from anywhere with internet connectivity. The combination of MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js provides a powerful solution for building and managing a dynamic blogging platform. Each stack component contributes unique capabilities for crafting cutting-edge websites.

**FRONT-END DEVELOPMENT** 

Front-End Developer is important to make and interactive websites and web applications. This focuses on the responsive functionality of a website; Front-End Development is also popular for the aesthetics and good user experience. It consists of constructing the user interface that user sees and interact. This involves employing languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to ensure seamless navigation and engaging design. 

I have made the Frontend using React, for UI Experience I have used Material UI.

**BACK-END DEVELOPMENT** 

The backend is like an administration room of a website. It handles data, ensures everything on the visible part works smoothly, but this all works on the back part of the website. User can't directly interact with it. 

Back-end frameworks are toolkits for building the hidden parts of websites. They come with ready-made tools, rules, and shortcuts that make it easier for developers to create powerful and reliable server using codes snippets without having to build everything from scratch. These frameworks handle common jobs like talking to databases, making sure users are verified, and deciding how different parts of a website should connect.  

I have made a file server.js has all the important dependencies and function for our server to work. There are two objects in collection one is User and another is Blog. So that the information of Blog and User are saved independently.
